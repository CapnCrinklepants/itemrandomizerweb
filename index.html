    <h1>item randomizer - very beta</h1>
    <p>
        This is a beta version used for testing new patches and item logic, have fun but expect that things can be broken at times.<br />
        <b>Huge shoutout and thanks to Dessyreqt for his work on the randomizer, without that this would not be a thing at all. <br />
        You can find his randomizer here: <a href="http://dessyreqt.github.io/smrandomizer/">Super Metroid Randomizer</a><br />

    <h2>Changes from the vanilla game and other notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Items are randomized in two pools: Major items/Reserves/E-tanks in one, and the ammo packs in another.</li>
        <li>There is one exception: The e-tank at Hi-Jump is no longer a major item location, it has been moved to the right super missile pack location in Wrecked Ship</li>
        <li>The door into the construction zone (blue brinstar ceiling e-tank room) is now a Blue door and will have zebes activated when you enter it so you can check the items there right away.</li>
        <li>The red tower elevator room's yellow door is blue to prevent softlocks</li>
        <li>Gravity no longer protects you from enviromental damage (heat, lava, acid, spikes). As a side effect, varia protects you from the same sources of damage twice as much as it normally would</li>
        <li>Because of the above change, Varia will never be in Lower Norfair</li>
        <li>Some cutscenes have been removed or shortened.</li>
        <li>Golden 4 Cutscene is eliminated, if you killed all four bosses, the way to Tourian is open immediately upon entering</li>
        <li>Suit animation cutscenes are gone, so it doesn't place you in the middle of the screen, potentially softlocking you in solid blocks</li>
        <li>You will no longer lose blue speed echoes while taking heat damage</li>
        <li>S/T beam is disabled</li>
        <li>GT Code is disabled</li>
        <li>The Intro sequence and Ceres station are no longer in the game, you instead start directly on Zebes from a blank file.</li>
    </ul>
