    <h1>item randomizer - very beta</h1>
    <p>
        This is a beta version used for testing new patches and item logic, have fun but expect that things can be broken at times.<br />
        <b>Huge shoutout and thanks to Dessyreqt for his work on the randomizer, without that this would not be a thing at all. <br />
        You can find his randomizer here: <a href="http://dessyreqt.github.io/smrandomizer/">Super Metroid Randomizer</a><br />

    <h2>Changes from the vanilla game and other notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Items are randomized in two pools: Major items/Reserves/E-tanks in one, and the ammo packs in another.</li>
        <li>There is on exception: The e-tank at Hi-Jump is no longer a major item location, it has been moved to the right super missile pack location in Wrecked Ship</li>
        <li>The door into the construction zone (blue brinstar ceiling e-tank room) is now a Blue door and will have zebes activated when you enter it so you can check the items there right away.</li>
        <li>Gravity suit will no longer give you protection from heat, so you will have to find Varia suit as well.</li>
        <li>Some cutscenes have been removed or shortened.</li>
        <li>Ceres station is no longer in the game.</li>
    </ul>
